# StockGrid: Inventory Management System

StockGrid is a web-based inventory management and Point-of-Sale (POS) system designed for retailers that buy, sell, and track unique, second-hand items. Inspired by the operational model of retailers like CEX, it streamlines inventory control by assigning a unique QR code to every item and offers flexible, secure login options for staff.

The application is built with a Python backend and a responsive frontend, allowing it to be used on both desktop terminals and mobile devices.
